      <p>
        John Doe, in full John Smith Doe, was born on October 15, 1931, in Rodshire
        <br><br>
        He served as the 11th President of the Republic from 2002 to 2007. 
        <br><br>
        John earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Atlas Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defense Research Organisation(DRO).
        <br><br>
        In 1969, he moved to the Rodshire Space Research where he was the director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in the Republic.
        <br><br>
        Rejoining the DRO in 1982, John planned the program that produced number of successful missiles, which helped earned him the nickname <strong>Missile Man</strong>
        <br>
        Among those successes was Argo, the Republic's first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989. 
        <br><br>
        He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in Rodshire's Pokhan-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by Rodshire in 1974. 
        <br> 
        From 1992 to 1997, John was scientific adviser to the Defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser(1999-2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. 
        <br> 
        His prominent role in the country's 1998 nuclear tests solidified Rodshire as a nuclear power and established John as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. 
        <br><br>
        In 1998, John put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming Rodshire from less-developed to a developed society in 20years. The plancalled for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizin technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to healthcare and education.
        <br><br>
        John received <b>7</b> honorary doctorates from <b>40</b> universities. The Government of Rodshire honoured him with <b>Padbushan in 1981</b> and the <b>Padvishan in 1990</b> for his work with RSR and DRO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.
        <br><br>
        In 1997, John received Rodshire's highest civilian honor, the Bharatna, for his contribution to scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.
        <br><br>
        In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognise excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".
        <br><br>
        While delivering a lecture at the Republic Institute of Management, John collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on <b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.
        <br><br>
        Wheeler Island, a national missile test site was renamed <b>John Island</b> in September 2015.
        <br><br>
        A prominent road in Dei was renamed from Aurazeb Road to <b>Dr John Smith Doe Road</b> in August 2015.
        <br><br>
        In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of Rodshire named a newly found plant species as Drypetes Johanii, in his honor.
